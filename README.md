# davey-rs
A [Discord Audio & Video End-to-End Encryption (DAVE) Protocol](https://daveprotocol.com/) implementation using [OpenMLS](https://openmls.tech/).
Forked from [Snazzah/davey](https://github.com/Snazzah/davey) to convert the library from a napi-rs module to a Rust crate.

> Proper documentation and usage doesn't currently exist, take a look at the [type definitions on the original repo](https://github.com/Snazzah/davey/blob/master/index.d.ts).
